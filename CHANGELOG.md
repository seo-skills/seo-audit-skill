## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- `content-keyword-stuffing` produced false positives on a majority of real
  pages. Root cause was a denominator mismatch: the minimum-length guard tested
  the raw token count (`>= 100`) while density divided by the post-stopword
  content-word count. Since roughly half of English prose is stopwords, a page
  clearing the guard was scored against a sample of ~50 words, where a term used
  3 times is 5.6% by arithmetic alone. The guard now measures the same
  population as the metric and requires 200 content words. Specifically:
  - Added an absolute floor of 5 occurrences before density is considered, so
    incidental repetition on short pages can no longer trip the rule.
  - The page's most frequent content word is now treated as its topic and
    allowed 8% density before flagging, so a video platform is no longer
    flagged for the word "video".
  - URLs, bare domains and emails are stripped before tokenizing, so
    `example.com` no longer contributes "com" as a keyword.
  - Added a `WEB_BOILERPLATE` stopword set covering interface chrome, file
    extensions and icon-font ligatures (`icon`, `menu`, `svg`, …), which leak
    into body text as literal text nodes.
  - Raised warn density 2% → 4% and severe 5% → 10%, and removed the branch
    that warned when a single term crossed the threshold.
  - The rule no longer returns `fail`. Term density cannot distinguish
    manipulation from a page that is simply about its topic, so its strongest
    verdict is now `warn`.

### Security

- LLM reporter now wraps all site-derived content (rule messages and details)
  in nonce-stamped `<untrusted-{nonce}>...</untrusted-{nonce}>` delimiters and
  emits a `<security-notice>` instructing the consuming LLM to treat those
  blocks as data only. Defends against indirect prompt injection from audited
  pages whose content reaches the report (e.g., a hostile `<title>` or meta
  description). The 128-bit per-report nonce prevents an attacker from forging
  a closing tag because they cannot predict it at audit time.
- LLM reporter now strips zero-width characters (U+200B–U+200D, U+2060,
  U+FEFF) and Unicode tag block characters (U+E0000–U+E007F) from quoted site
  content before XML escaping. The Unicode tag block is the dominant
  invisible-prompt-injection vector — characters render as zero pixels but
  carry hidden ASCII instructions LLMs will read.
- Removed `context7.json` from the repository. The file contained only a
  Context7 documentation-service public identifier (analogous to a Stripe
  publishable key — designed to ship in source) but tripped a credential
  scanner via `pk_<base62>` regex matching.

### Added

- `src/reporters/llm-reporter.test.ts` — covers the new security envelope:
  nonce uniqueness, security-notice presence, untrusted-block wrapping for
  messages and details, fix-suggestion exemption, zero-width and Unicode-tag
  character stripping, and closing-tag forgery defense via XML escaping.
- "Trust Model" section in `SKILL.md` documenting the layered defense applied
  to LLM-format output.

### Changed

- `references/rules.md` (and `skill/references/rules.md`) rewritten from the
  stale v1.2.2 rule set (55 rules / 9 categories, `meta-tags-*`/`headings-*`
  IDs) to the current v3.0.0 reference: all 20 categories with weights and
  rule counts, `<category>-<name>` ID convention, score grades, and CWV
  thresholds.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-05-06

### Fixed

- Republished `dist/index.js` so the programmatic entry point
  (`import { createAuditor } from '@seomator/seo-audit'`) works on npm. The
  source was correct, but the `3.0.0` tarball was missing the library build
  artifact, causing programmatic consumers to receive an undefined export.

### Added

- Integration test suite for the programmatic API (`src/auditor.test.ts`).
  Covers `createAuditor` / `Auditor` exports, default-vs-filtered category
  selection, the `AuditResult` shape returned by `audit()`, lifecycle callback
  ordering (`onCategoryStart` → `onRuleComplete*` → `onCategoryComplete`), and
  the single-fetch invariant. Imports through `./index.js` to mirror the npm
  consumer entry point and catch packaging regressions like the one reported
  against the published `3.0.0` artifact.
